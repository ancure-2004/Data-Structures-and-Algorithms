# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms questions and solutions from various platforms and SDE (Software Development Engineer) sheets. It is designed to help you prepare for coding interviews and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Repository Description

- Questions from popular coding platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc.)
- SDE sheets including Striver, Love Babbar, and others
- Solutions in C++ and other languages
- Well-organized by topic: Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Strings, Arrays, Trees, Graphs, and more
- Includes explanations and optimized approaches

## What are Data Structures?

Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## What are Algorithms?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are used to manipulate data in data structures and solve computational problems. Examples include:
- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## How to Use This Repository

- Browse folders by topic or platform
- Study solutions and explanations
- Practice by attempting problems yourself
- Use this as a reference for interview preparation
